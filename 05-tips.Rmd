# Pro Tips

This section outlines some useful commands to make Git a little more user friendly.

## Log Customisation and Aliases

You can customise the log by adding extra arguments. For example, adding the `--oneline` argument the log is cut down to one line per commit.
```sh
git log --oneline
```

There are a lot of possible argument to add to the log. This example will show the latest commit on each branch, give a rough branching diagram and put the date in a specified format.

```sh
git log --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h%Creset %an| %Cgreen%cd%Creset %s %C(cyan)%d' --graph --all --date=format:'%Y/%m/%d %H:%M'
```
All the possible arguments to add to `git log` are in the documentation [here](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-log).

Eventually you'll have too many arguments to sensibly type, so you can use an alias. An alias allows you to define a new command based on an old command. You define one like this:
```sh
git config --global alias.<your_alias_name> = <your_command>
```

After this you can type 
```sh
git <your_alias_name>
```
to carry out the command.

For example, using the long, customised log from above we can define a new command, "hist".

```sh
git config --global alias.hist = log --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h%Creset %an| %Cgreen%cd%Creset %s %C(cyan)%d' --graph --all --date=format:'%Y/%m/%d %H:%M'
```

Allowing us to type: 
```sh
git hist
```
to view a fancy version of the log, without having to type out a huge command!

## Difftool

If you put in a request to IT to install WinMerge you can use it to view differences between old and new versions of your files side-by-side. You can also edit from within Winmerge - this is useful just before you commit to make sure that everything you changed is something you wanted to change.

Open your .gitconfig file 
```sh
git config --global -e
```

(this is a lot easier if you've set up Notepad, or Notepad++ as your core editor) and copy this in:

```sh
[diff]
  tool = winmerge

[difftool "winmerge"]
  name = WinMerge
  trustExitCode = true
  cmd = "'C:/Program Files (x86)/WinMerge/WinMergeU.exe'" -e "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"

[difftool]
  prompt = false
```
save and exit.

From now on you can type
```sh
git difftool
```
when you have uncommitted changes to view the difference between them and the last commit.

To view the differences between your current version and an old commit, type
```sh
git difftool HEAD~<n>
```
where <n> is the number of commits back to want to compare to.

To view the differences between your current branch and another branch type
```sh
git difftool <other branch name>
```
  
## Amend

If you've just committed some changes but realised a mistake in them you can "amend" the commit. However, this should be done before you push your changes! Things can get complicated if you try amending public commits.

To amend the the commit, correct the file, add the file in Git and then use:
```sh
git commit --amend
```
to combine the correction into the previous commit (technically this combines both commits into a new commit that overwrites the last one).

If your Git history looks like this:
```
51d070b Some User | 2018/01/27 11:08 Corrected more mistakes
eacd280 Some User | 2018/01/27 11:07 Corrected mistake in last commit
909246a Some User | 2018/01/27 10:50 Corrected typos in last change
00286d6 Some User | 2018/01/27 10:44 Added new feature
```

If you've made a typo in your commit message you can also correct it with amend. Say your last commit looks like this:
```
109563e Some User | 2018/01/27 10:44 Added mew featuere
```

Adding the `-m` flag to your amend allows you to add a new comment.
```sh
git commit --amend -m "Added new feature"
```

```
23237f1 Some User | 2018/01/27 10:44 Added new feature
```

## Stash

If you start making changes in the wrong branch and haven't committed them yet, Git won't allow you to change branches. 

The stash command allows you to store your file changes away, allowing you to change branch, so you can bring them back up when you want.

```sh
git stash
```
Will store away any changes. If you check `git status` you'll see that your file changes no longer appear.

After you switch branch
```sh
git checkout <your_branch>
```
you can then type 
```sh
git stash pop
```
to bring your changes back.
