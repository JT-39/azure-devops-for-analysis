# DevOps - The Basics

## Background

So far we have only looked at Git in the context of local projects and command line software. This alone doesn't make collaborating on code easy. 

What is needed is a central platform where people can request for changes to be made to the code base and update their code based on changes by others.  

This concept in Git is known as [remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes) or remote repositories.
The following are examples of interactive services that allow you to manage Git projects effectively:

- [GitHub](github.com)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
- [GitLab](gitlab.com/)
- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/).

We are using **Azure DevOps** as this is the Department's tool of choice for internal version control. We would use platforms such as GitHub for our more publicly facing projects (such as this book).

To work with internal DevOps Repos you will need an account with Basic access level.
There is a form to sort out DevOps account levels and access on the IT service portal - search for DevOps.
You will also need someone to give you permission to see the DevOps project that you're working on.
For information about how to do this, pleae read on.
If you need a new project area on DevOps, use the same IT service portal form as for account access.

## Theory 

At a high level when you are using DevOps (or any type of remote) you are creating a central copy of your code on a server (the DevOps site). 

The aim of any project is to get your final complete code on to the main branch of the server copy. Analysts will still make and run all their changes locally but will then use the concepts of *pushing*, *pulling* and *pull requesting* to get the DevOps version up to date.

Having this central repository and the approval processes that DevOps provides means that multiple analysts can work on a project at the same time and systematically merge all their changes into the final version after code review.

The following diagram illustrates the concept of server and local copies.

## Creating a DevOps repository for a new project

To set up a repository on DevOps you need to:

1. Open the DevOps website.
2. Navigate to repositories.
3. Find the current repository name at the top of page and click on it to bring up a dropdown menu.
4. Click "add respository" and give it a suitable name.

This will create you a Git repo on DevOps. By default it will give you a main branch and a README file.

### Clone to your computer

Cloning a repository means that you:

1. Get a copy of it on your computer.
2. Your computer stores where to find the online copy so it can talk to the online one when you ask it to.

To clone the blank repository to your computer you need to get the repo's URL.
It is easiest to do this by:

1. Going to "Files" in the "Repos" section of DevOps.
2. Ensuring you are in the right repository by checking the name in the banner at the top of the screen.
3. Clicking the clone button in the top right-hand corner.
4. Copying the URL.

Once you have copied the URL, you need to open git bash on your computer and clone the repository using the URL.
When you open git bash you should do so in the folder where you want the repo to be.
Ideally this will be on your C drive, outside of OneDrive of Teams because git repositories don't work well if OneDrive
or Teams are syncing them.
There is no need for the additional syncing from OneDrive or Teams because DevOps provides the online back-up that others can access.
This means that any general rules than work should be on OneDrive or Teams to be backed up does not apply to repos because DevOps provides the back-up *as long as you push your work regularly and at least once a day*.

One you've got git bash open, the clone command will look as follows:

```sh
git clone git_repo_url
```

If you are working on EDAP, it is best to clone the repo to your P drive.


## Creating a git repository for a project you've been doing on your computer

If you have already been working on a project locally you may wish to push this up and use this as the starting point for the collaborative workflow.

In this case, create a new repository on DevOps but before you click the "Create" button after giving you repository a name, untick the "Add a README" box. This will give a truly blank repository.

Once you click "Create" you will be take to a screen which says your new repository is empty.
There will be an option to *Push an existing repository from command line*.

In order to Push an existing repository you need to do the following:

1. Open Git Bash in your local Git repo
2. Copy the code from the DevOps section and run it

This will set up the connection to DevOps and push an entire copy of the repo up to DevOps.

## Adding users to a project

DevOps is a restriced access code environment where users need to first be given permission to access the site as a whole and then individual projects. 

To add users to a project:

1. In the Overview section, go to the summary page 
2. Click on the invite button in the top, right hand corner
2. Search for user
3. Click Add

The user will then get a welcome email inviting them to the project.

## Pull Requests

A pull request is a particularly useful bit of DevOps functionality.
You can access pull requests from the "pull requests" page under DevOps repos section.

A pull request in effect provides a wrapper for the ```git merge``` command outlined in Chapter 2.
The visual interface allows you to:

1. Give background to the changes made and link any work items
2. Assign a colleague, or colleagues, to conduct a code review on the changes made
3. Discuss the changes and resolve any requests for improvements
4. Present the differences between the two branches in a visual manner (added/removed) so that you can easily see exactly what has been changed.

As a pull request ensures someone reviews your code before it is incorporated into the main/master branch it is a good tool for quality assurance. Having another person look over your code before it is accepted reduces the risk of errors being missed.

A good way of working involves all merging of new work is done by pull request to enfore the review process.
Pull requests are most successful when they contain a smaller number of changes because it is less likely the reviewer will miss something important.

If you are writing a pull request, it is a good idea to include:

1. Why you were doing the work you've done.
2. Any context to the assumptions you've made whilst doing the work.
3. A list of specific points that you would like your reviewer to check. This should always include that the code is clear enough and whether it requires further comments.

Once you are happy with the code review that's taken place in a pull request:

1. The person reviewing it approves the request to mark that the review is finished.
2. The person who wrote the code and set the pull request up "completes" it which performs the merge.

DevOps will delete the branch you were working in (the source brancg) once complete the pull request.
This is good practice because it keeps the repo tidy.
Deleting branches after you have merged the work elsewhere does not mean you lose work because all that work is on the branch you've merged to.

## Branch Policies

At this point you will have a project that anyone who is a member of has the ability to push directly to the main/master branch. 

Best practice ways of working include frequent code reviews v requests to support Quality Assurance.
Pushing to main/master doesn't allow this directly. 

Instead what we do is set **Branch Policies** which force code to be reviewed in DevOps before it can be merged into main/master.
If you set any branch policies, changes to main/master have to be made using a pull request.

### How to set branch policies

To set branch policies:

1. Go the the "Branched" page under repos in DevOps. Make sure you are looking at your intended repo by checking the centre top of the page.
2. Hover your mouse over your main/master branch and click on the three vertical dots that appear at the right hand side of the screen.
3. Clock on "Branch policies" in the menu that appears.

### The branch policy options

At the time of writing, branch policies offer four options:

1. **Require a minimum number of reviewers** - how many people need to approve the code before it can be merged.
2. **Check for linked work items** - Does the pull request need to have a work item linked
3. **Check for comment resolution** - Do all of the comments on the pull request need to be resolved before merging is approved
4. **Limit merge types** - Do you want to enforce a merge strategy. 

It is recommended that you **enforce at least the first option**. 

When you start to feel confident with Git and DevOps, you may wish to think about limiting the merge types.
If you limit merge types, you will get a cleaner commit history which is easier to interrogate.

The four options for merge types are:

1. Basic merge (no fast-forward). This is the default and preserves your history exactly as it happened when you wrote your code.
2. Squash merge. When you complete your pull request just a single commit is created on main/master containing all your work. This is a good approach for big projects where you don't need to be able to see your intermediate steps. It is well suited to software development but may be less suitable for analytical work, especially if any of your code on intermediate steps (commits) was used to produce any form of outputs.
3. Rebase and fast-forward. This gives your repo a linear history by reworking the commits covered by your pull request so they just cover additional work needed on top of the current state of main/master.
4. Rebase with merge commit. This is like option 3 but it adds an additional commit which records a pull request has been completed. If you are using pull requests to support QA, this is probably a good thing because it ensures the use of a pull request is logged in your version history.
